My professional background is in hospitality and retail management, most recently I worked as the Retail Operations Manager for a small, London-based menswear brand. Since early childhood (I grew up on my parents' Macintosh Performa 5200) I've loved computers and have had a fascination with coding. After feeling increasingly bored and under-challenged in my last job I had a eureka moment and decided that a career in software was for me. I succesfully applied to Makers Academy soon after this and am very much looking forward to beginning my new career.


## Skills

#### Problem Solving

I've always enjoyed problem solving, lateral thinking and logical reasoning. I often find it surprisingly straightforward to teach myself new skills by applying a logical and practical approach to learning them.

- Over the past two years I taught myself a great deal of mechanic engineering and automotive maintenance - I recently overhauled the engine block in my car.
- I taught myself Python to an intermediate level in a few weeks at home whilst still at my previous job. I eventually built a simple Python program to automate an extremely repetetive task at work and saved myself and my team almost 8 hours a month.

#### Team Working

Throughout my working life I've always worked in tight-knit teams, often in a leadership role. I thoroughly enjoy working as part of a team to achieve a shared goal.
