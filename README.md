My professional background is in hospitality and retail management, prior to moving into the tech industry, my most recent position was working as the Retail Operations Manager for a small, London-based menswear brand. Since early childhood (I grew up on my parents' Macintosh Performa 5200) I've loved computers and have had a fascination with coding. I've also always been passionate about building and fixing things, as well as taking them apart and trying to figure out what makes them tick. While feeling increasingly bored and under-challenged in my last job I had a eureka moment and decided that a career in software was for me. I succesfully applied to Makers Academy soon after this, and am now thoroughly enjoying life as a software engineer.


## Key Skills

#### Problem Solving

- I've always enjoyed problem solving, lateral thinking and logical reasoning. I often find it surprisingly straightforward to teach myself new skills by applying a logical and practical approach to learning them.
- Over the past two years I taught myself a great deal of mechanic engineering and automotive maintenance - I recently overhauled the engine block in my car, single handed.
- I taught myself Python to an intermediate level in a few weeks at home whilst still at my previous job. I eventually built a simple Python program to automate an extremely repetetive task at work and saved myself and my team almost 8 hours a month.

#### Team Working

- Throughout my working life I've always worked in tight-knit teams, often in a leadership role. I thoroughly enjoy working as part of a team to achieve a shared goal.

#### Communication

- I have a great deal of experience working in customer-facing roles where good communication is absolutely vital. Not least during my four years of service with the Metropolitan Police.
